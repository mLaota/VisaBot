# VisaBot

Discord bot designed for temporary role management. Certain channels and/or
categories may be restricted to specific roles. Based off the concept of
visa administration, the VisaBot allows "sponsors" to administer "visas" to
"tourists". A sponsor represents a role with desirable access permissions.
Using VisaBot, a sponsor can administer a temporary visa (in the form of
a visa role) to another member of the same Discord server. The visa role
should have the necessary permissions pre-configured for the destination.

The visa mechanism helps maintain the privacy of certain channels while also
giving users the freedom to allow temporary exceptions and visitors, rather
than trying to encapsulate all of the combinations of roles in respective servers.
